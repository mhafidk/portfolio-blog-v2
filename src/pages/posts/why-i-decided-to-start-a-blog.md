The idea of starting a blog came up when I was making my portfolio website. I was confused about the content of my portfolio website. If the content of my website were only about myself, my experiences, my projects, and tools I have used, I felt like my website would be empty. Based on my finding, there are a lot of portfolio websites that also function as a blog. But, those 2 reasons still not convince me to start a blog.

The reasons that convince me to start a blog are.

## To improve myself

Yep, that’s true. I know my weaknesses. One of them is in writing skill. People can write, but are the results always good? No. A good writing is a writing that is easy to be understand, elaborate and connect the ideas well, and use appropriate words.

That is my weakness. Sometimes when I want to write something, I have the ideas on my mind, but I have a hard time to express them in my writing, I am confused how to connect the ideas, I do not know the proper words to express the ideas. Have you ever experienced it?

That is why I started this blog, to improve my writing skill.

Writing a blog post not only improve my writing skill, but also my communication skill in general!

## To understand something better

There is a famous saying.

> While we teach, we learn.
>

Have you heard about it? I bet you have. In my opinion, it is true. We will understand more after we teach someone else.

In my blog, I also want to write about technical stuff, such as learning programming language, how to do something, programming concepts, etc. So, while I am writing about those topics, I imagine myself as a teacher.

Furthermore, before I write about something I will study about it first.

## To share my knowledge

> Sharing is caring

Isn't that right?

Whenever I have blockers, errors, or something that I do not know I will search the solution on the internet. Sometimes, I find the solutions on a blog. I thank to the blog writers, because thanks to them, I can solve my problems.

I hope what I have written or am going to write can also help to solve other people problems.

## To make me stand out

How many software engineers in the world? Many. In Indonesia alone, there are a lot of software engineers. So, how to be stand out in the sea of software engineers? There are numerous ways. I chose blogging as the method to be different from other software engineers.

I hope, my writing can become a prove that I understand about the topic I have written.

Those 4 reasons are the ones that convince me to write consistently. To be able to achieve my goals, one, two, or three posts are not enough.

Does every software engineer need to have their own blog? No. Blogging is only one of the methods to improve our skills. In my opinion, blogging is the most suitable way for me to improve myself and I am interested to write.

Can I write consistently? Of course I can!

Every Friday there will be a new post here!
