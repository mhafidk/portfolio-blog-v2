Ever heard about Go or Golang? If you are a software developer, I think you have heard about Go before. So, what is Go?

Go or Golang is an open source, compiled, and statically typed programming language developed by Google and is distributed under a BSD-style license.

Why Go is also often called Golang? Which one is the real name?

Golang came from the official website of Go, [golang.org](http://golang.org). The proper name is Go.


# Brief History of Go

The history of Go goes back to 2007 when Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson started sketching the goals for a new language on the white board.

On November 10, 2009 Go became a public open source project where other software engineers could contribute and collaborate on making Go a better programming language. The version 1.0 of Go was released 3 years later in 2012. Go keeps evolving day by day, month by month, and year by year until the current stable version Go, 1.20.5.

Go was made by combining useful characteristics from other programming languages, such as static typing and run-time efficiency from C, readability and usability from Python and JavaScript, to address problems with current programming languages at the time. There were none programming language that had efficient compilation, efficient execution, and ease of programming.

Go remains as one of the top programming languages until now. Many big companies use Go like Google, Netflix, Docker, Dropbox, GOJEK, Tokopedia, and lots more.


# Why I Learned Go?

## Simple and Easy to Learn

Go is a simple and easy to learn programming language due to its minimalistic syntax and straightforward approach. It was design to be like that, simple and familiar. It is a great language for beginners, as well as for experienced developers who want to quickly build scalable and efficient applications.

There are less than 30 keywords!

Due to its minimalistic syntax, you won’t need to spend your time going through reference documentation. Not only that, but also the format is clean and easy to read, that makes the code easy to understand.

## Versatile

In addition to being easy to learn, Go is a multipurpose programming language, so it can be used for developing a wide range of applications, from web applications, operating systems, data science, cloud computing, etc.

One of implementations of Go in big companies is Google's download server, `dl.google.com`.

## Active Community

Go has a very active community of developers who are constantly working on improving the language and creating new libraries and frameworks. This makes it easy to find resources and support when learning or working with Go.

Since the first stable version of Go was released, the number of people use Go increase day by day. Based on the [research](https://research.swtch.com/gophercount) in 2021, there were 1.6 to 2.5 million Go developers around the world. Another survey, [Developer Ecosystem Survey 2020](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/go/), that was conducted in 2020 shows that Go is among the top 10 primary languages of professional developers.

## High Demand

There is a high demand for Go developers in the tech industry, as more and more companies are adopting Go as their primary language for building scalable and efficient applications.

Go was built to answer problems of software industry. So, it is only natural that numerous companies use Go to tackle their problems. Go’s performance, speed, concurrency, and scalability are some advantages that attract big companies to use Go.
