Hello world!

April 8, 2023, my first post here! Long story short, I have made this "first post" multiple times because I also have made this portfolio website multiple times too. After trial and error, finally, I am satisfied with the result. I am proud of myself :D

What's next?

This blog maybe will be filled by my own personal notes about everything I have on my mind. I want to write about Go, because I want to start a project using Go!

Ciao~
