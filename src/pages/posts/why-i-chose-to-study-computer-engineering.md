I did not really think about what major I should take when I was in high school. Whenever I was asked,

> What do you want to do in the future? What major do you want to take?

I would answer

> A doctor

But it changed after I was in 12th grade. Maybe because it was near graduation and a lot of my friends already knew what they wanted to do in the future. So, I started thinking about my future.

Because I still did not know what major I wanted to take. I eliminated things that I wanted to avoid. There were only two, what were they?

1. Chemistry
2. Biology

Why I wanted to avoid those two? Well, it was based on my chemistry and biology grades that were bad and when I tried to study about both of them, I could not enjoy the study, it just made me confused. So, I decided to avoid chemistry and biology.

After I eliminated chemistry and biology, my options narrowed. Finally, I had two options that were computer and design related majors. After that, I gathered information about those two majors.

Design related majors was quite interesting, but... I realized that I was not really gifted in the field. Additionally, design related majors belonged in humanities study.

My last option was computer related majors. Why I wanted to take computer related major? I still did not know about computer, moreover coding. I also did not know the prospect career of this major. So why? Read a little bit more.

After I decided to take computer major. I did my own research to find information about computer major. I needed to know what I would study, the prospect career, and opinions about computer major from other people.

I started coding, and... I found it interesting! I was also fascinated by the things that I would learn later. I also thought that a career in computer industry was cool. Now, I am working in software industry and it is really cool! It is true that if you want to know something, you need to dive down to it first.

Why I chose computer engineering?

Based on my little research, I felt that computer engineering was interesting, far more interesting than any other computer related major. Did I regret to take computer engineering major? Short answer **No**, long answer about in, ins and outs about computer engineering will be presented in my next post!

See ya~
