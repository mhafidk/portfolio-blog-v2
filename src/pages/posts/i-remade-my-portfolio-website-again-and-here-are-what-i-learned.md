How many times I have remade my portfolio website? Maybe about 6 or 7 times.

I created my first portfolio website in 2021. But, I only made it just for fun, I wanted to try various JavaScript frameworks, css frameworks, and deployment platforms. I did not really pay attention whether my portfolio website was seen by other people or not. Maybe when I made this site for the 5 times, I started to think about it seriously.

So, here are the reasons I remade my portfolio website (again).

## 1.  I was inspired while looking other portfolio websites

I like to read articles about any topics. I read articles from any sources, medium, dev community, or other developer blogs. The articles were not the only one I paid attention to. There were some parts of the UIs that were amazed me!

I thought, “I think it will be nice if I add something like that in my website”. So, I added them to my wish list.

I end up with long list of reference, looking at the list makes me want to implement them on my portfolio website.

## 2.  I wanted to learn more about frontend development

Although I am a web developer who focuses on backend development, I also want to learn and understand the magic behind the frontend development. I think by doing that will make my understanding of web development in general increase and make me a better web developer.

And that is true. I understand more about web development. Not only I learned about frontend development, but also made me a better backend developer! I understand more and more about the relation between frontend and backend.

I have tried some of popular frameworks, such as NextJs, NuxtJS, and SvelteKit.

## 3.  It was fun!

Last but not least, it was fun!

Building a website is fun! I enjoyed my time styling each element than I thought, although it is hard sometimes, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Experimenting with numerous designs, trying various colors, confused why the div won’t be in the center, etc.

By making my portfolio website multiple times, I got valuable lessons. I learned various things from the trials and errors.

## 1.  Deeper understanding about frontend development

This is one of the reasons why I wanted to make my own portfolio website. I rarely interact with frontend related things in my work. I only had learned about frontend development before I got my current job, backend developer, but it was only the surface.

Therefore, I made this site. I learned a lot from making this site, especially about the frontend development. I can pick up where I left.

It is true that the best way to learn is by doing!

## 2.  Planning and organizing a project

When I first built my portfolio website. I did not make any plan, I just did whatever I wanted to do.

I was designing the UI for my portfolio website and minutes later I was researching the frameworks I wanted to use. It was a mess, it was not planned and organized well. As a result, the progress was slow.

After that, I started planning and organizing to build my portfolio website, such as breaking down tasks to smaller parts, setting up deadlines for each task, and making an achievable and realistic timeline. By doing this, my work became more structured and easier.

## 3.  Writing good contents require a lot of effort

Building a portfolio website is not only about designing an eye catching UI, but also making a content that attracts reader. You need to write good content so people want to scroll down to the very end of your website.

I spent quite a lot of time thinking about the right words for my landing page and about me page.

## 4.  Do not think to deeply about framework

At first, I thought too much about which framework I should use for my portfolio website. I spent a lot of time reading articles about each framework and watching youtube videos comparing multiple frameworks. If I spent those time to do the website, then I would have done a lot.

If you are a beginner that want to learn something for the first time, pick the most popular one. Why? Because being popular means lots of people use it and have big community. So, if you have any problems, you do not have a hard time to find the solution.

Furthermore, those frameworks have the same principle, when you understand one, it will be easier for you to use the others.

Beside the change of user interface, I made some improvements to this site. Although, they are not really big improvements, I am still happy about them!

The improvements are contact form and the mobile view navigation bar. I added a contact form in the contact me section, I used formspark. It was easy to setup the form and the free tier they offered is quite generous!

When I will remade my portfolio again? I do not know...

さようなら~
